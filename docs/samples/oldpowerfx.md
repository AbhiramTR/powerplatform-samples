Microsoft Power Fx is a low-code general purpose programming language based on spreadsheet-like formulas. It is a strongly typed, declarative, and functional language, with imperative logic and state management available as needed.

Right now, you can use these Power Fx samples within your Power Apps canvas applications, but you'll be able to use Power Fx in more Microsoft Power Platform products in the future.
