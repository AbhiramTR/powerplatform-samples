Please do not open GitHub issues for general support questions as the GitHub list should be used for feature requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.

If you have questions about how to use SharePoint Framework or any of the provided samples, please use the following locations.

* [Power Platform Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/) at https://powerusers.microsoft.com/
* [Power Platform Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/power-platform/bd-p/PowerPlatform)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), using the tags associated with the Power Platform technology you're having difficulties with

If you experience an issue with one of the provided samples open an issue in GitHub in the repository where the sample is stored and we'll try to help you.
