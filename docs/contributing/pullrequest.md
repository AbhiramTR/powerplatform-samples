To submit your sample or to make changes to an existing sample, you need to create a GitHub pull request in the repository appropriate for each sample type.

Although the process is similar across all the repositories, each sample type may require you to take additional steps and/or provide additional information. 

For more information on how to submit a pull request for each sample type, please refer to these repositories:

- [Power Fx Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerfx-samples)
- [Power Apps Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerapps-samples)
- [Power Automate Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerautomate-samples)
- [Power Virtual Agents Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerva-samples)

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the above repositories are still under construction and may not be actively accepting pull requests at the moment. Feel free to reach out to the respective repository owners if you'd like to be the first to provide samples on those repositories.
